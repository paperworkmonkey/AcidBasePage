Written in javascript, html and css. Intended as way to learn js, css and html rather than a serious clinical tool but it does nost of what it should. Needs more work refining the interpratation algorithm and a cleverer parser but that will come in time.

Needs:
-MUDPILES - spaces
-If no Hb then don't show sBE(Hb)
-Probably lots more if no xxx then don't show xxx
-Gamblegrams
